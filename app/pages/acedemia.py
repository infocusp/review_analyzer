    You are an AI assistant specializing in **extracting structured insights from Spotify user reviews**.
    Your goal is to **identify key entities, classify sentiment, and avoid redundant entity creation**.

    ### **Key Responsibilities**
    - **Extract entities**: Identify relevant aspects in reviews.
    - **Standardize names**: Group similar entities to avoid duplication.
    - **Assign sentiment**: Classify as `Positive` or `Negative`, ignoring neutral statements.
    - **Track occurrences**: Store review IDs under respective sentiment categories.

    ### **Important Instructions**
    - Focus on **meaning and implication** of the review sentence, not just keywords.

        [Seat Comfort, Baggage Handling, Food Quality]

        You are tasked with extracting entities and their corresponding sentiment from the new set of reviews:
        review-301: The airport lounge smelled like bleach and old cheese, wasted a credit card voucher.
        review-302: Our 9-hour flight became 15 because of a missed connection. Not a single announcement, just mass confusion.
        review-303: I'll never forget the gate agent who sprinted across the terminal to return my passport. Heroes wear hi-vis vests too.
        review-304: Won't recommend this airline at all, only book if it's the only option left.
        review-305: The business class seat reclined so far I thought I'd need a chiropractor ‚Äî but honestly, I haven't slept that well in weeks.
        review-306: The baggage claim at JFK is like a reverse lottery. You wait, pray, and still go home empty-handed. Mine came 2 days later smelling like diesel.
        review-307: I loved the mobile app! Boarding passes, gate info, luggage tracking ‚Äî everything worked without needing to talk to a single human. That's a win for me.
        review-308: I travel often for work, and usually have my routine down to a science. But this time? From the start, things felt... off. The check-in process dragged‚Äînot because of a line, but because no one seemed to know how to handle a passport that wouldn't scan. I ended up being bounced between counters like a pinball. The flight was uneventful, which I normally appreciate, but somehow I left the plane feeling more drained than usual. Maybe it was the constant buzzing from the overhead bin or the stale air. What stuck with me most though was post-landing ‚Äî standing alone at the carousel long after everyone else had left, realizing my bag wasn't coming. No apology from the staff, Just a form and a shrug.

        review-904: Season one had magic. Season two has‚Ä¶flashbacks. So many flashbacks. I spent half the runtime trying to remember what happened in season one.
        review-905: The plot got lost somewhere around episode four.
        review-906: I cried. I laughed. I tweeted angrily at the writers. Isn't that what TV is supposed to do?

        - **Playlist (3,548 mentions)** also has high mentions, suggesting that playlist management is a crucial aspect for users.
        - **Podcast (1,563 mentions)** and **Subscription Cost (1,557 mentions)** are frequently discussed, likely reflecting user opinions on content variety and pricing concerns.
        - **Player Controls (1,246 mentions)** and **Shuffle Feature (1,185 mentions)** are also major topics, highlighting user interest in playback functionality.
        - **UI (1,147 mentions)** and **Audio Quality (1,104 mentions)** indicate that user experience and sound quality are important factors.
